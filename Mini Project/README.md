# Kubernetes troubleshooting

**Name:** Mayank Gupta
**Roll No:** 24BCS10220
**Repository:** [mayank-0789/Devops-Assignment-1](https://github.com/mayank-0789/Devops-Assignment-1)

## What this lab contains

A broken Service selector gives empty endpoints; correcting the selector restores them.

Top-level resources: `manifests`.

[Detailed adapted walkthrough](REFERENCE.md) · [Source provenance](../SOURCE.md) · [Validation scope](../VALIDATION.md)

The walkthrough retains source example commands and outputs for study. Its historical screenshots were omitted. Workflow names and completion claims in that reference describe the source design; the active workflow in this repository is `.github/workflows/validate-labs.yml`.

## Run the lab

Run these commands from this folder. Use a disposable lab environment. Linux commands need a Linux host; Docker commands need a running Docker engine; Kubernetes/Helm commands need a reachable cluster.

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f manifests/service-broken.yaml
kubectl get endpoints troubleshooting-service
kubectl apply -f manifests/service.yaml
kubectl get endpoints troubleshooting-service
```

## Fresh execution evidence

The **kubernetes** job in [Validate Mayank DevOps labs](https://github.com/mayank-0789/Devops-Assignment-1/actions/workflows/validate-labs.yml) executes the scope above. The screenshot shows actual recorded CI commands/output; it proves only those checks.
