## What this lab contains

Formatting, provider initialization and terraform validate for the VPC/EC2/S3 configuration. No cloud apply or destroy is claimed.

Top-level resources: `localstack.tfvars`, `main.tf`, `outputs.tf`, `provider.tf`, `terraform.tfvars`, `variables.tf`.

[Detailed adapted walkthrough](REFERENCE.md) · [Source provenance](../SOURCE.md) · [Validation scope](../VALIDATION.md)

The walkthrough retains source example commands and outputs for study. Its historical screenshots were omitted. Workflow names and completion claims in that reference describe the source design; the active workflow in this repository is `.github/workflows/validate-labs.yml`.

## Run the lab

Run these commands from this folder. Use a disposable lab environment. Linux commands need a Linux host; Docker commands need a running Docker engine; Kubernetes/Helm commands need a reachable cluster.

```bash
terraform fmt -check
terraform init -backend=false
terraform validate
```
