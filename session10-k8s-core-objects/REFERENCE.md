These adapted manifests and example outputs explain each task against a local minikube cluster. Fresh validation evidence for this repository is listed below. Where the macOS Docker driver got in the way (NodePorts are not reachable from the Mac itself) I say so and show what I did instead.

All 35 manifests pass `kubectl apply --dry-run=client`. Every one of them was also applied for real, as the screenshots show.

## Task 1: Cluster health check

```bash
kubectl version
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

Client and server are both v1.37.0. The API server is reachable on a localhost port that minikube forwards into the Docker container, and CoreDNS is running. My cluster has one node that is both control plane and worker.

```
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:51232
CoreDNS is running at https://127.0.0.1:51232/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

NAME       STATUS   ROLES           AGE    VERSION   INTERNAL-IP    OS-IMAGE                         CONTAINER-RUNTIME
minikube   Ready    control-plane   5d4h   v1.37.0   192.168.49.2   Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)   containerd://2.3.4
```


---

## Task 2: A plain Pod (`pod.yml`)

The manifest has the four required top-level fields: `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata` and `spec`. It runs one `nginx:1.27-alpine` container.

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yml
kubectl get pods
kubectl get pods -o wide
kubectl logs nginx-pod
kubectl delete -f pod.yml
kubectl get pods
```

The pod was `1/1 Running` within six seconds, got pod IP `10.244.0.4` on node `minikube`, and the logs show nginx 1.27.5 starting its worker processes. After the delete, `kubectl get pods` returns nothing.


---

## Task 3: ErrImagePull and ImagePullBackOff

`pod-lifecycle/06-imagepullbackoff.yaml` asks for `nginx:this-tag-does-not-exist-mayank`. The API server accepts the object (the YAML is valid), but the kubelet cannot pull the image.

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod-lifecycle/06-imagepullbackoff.yaml
kubectl get pods lifecycle-image-error
kubectl describe pod lifecycle-image-error | grep -A 10 Events:
kubectl delete -f pod-lifecycle/06-imagepullbackoff.yaml
```

The status column shows `ErrImagePull` right after each failed attempt, and the events show the kubelet alternating between `Pulling`, `Failed ... not found`, `ErrImagePull` and `BackOff` / `ImagePullBackOff` with a growing delay between attempts.


---

## Task 4: Watching a short-lived pod (`hello.yml`)

`hello-pod` runs busybox, prints one line, sleeps three seconds and exits 0. With `restartPolicy: Never` it ends in `Completed`.

I started `kubectl get pods -w` in a second terminal before applying, so the watch caught every transition:

```
hello-pod   0/1     Pending             0          0s
hello-pod   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s
hello-pod   1/1     Running             0          0s
hello-pod   0/1     Completed           0          4s
```

`kubectl logs hello-pod` prints `Hello from Mayank busybox pod`.


---

## Task 5: Pod lifecycle and probes lab (`pod-lifecycle/`)

| File | Pod | What it shows on my cluster |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `01-running.yaml` | `lifecycle-running` | Normal Running pod |
| `02-pending.yaml` | `lifecycle-pending` | Requests 900Gi memory, stays `Pending` with `FailedScheduling: 0/1 nodes are available: 1 Insufficient memory` |
| `03-succeeded.yaml` | `lifecycle-succeeded` | Exit 0 with `restartPolicy: Never` |
| `04-failed.yaml` | `lifecycle-failed` | Exit 1 with `restartPolicy: Never` |
| `05-crashloopbackoff.yaml` | `lifecycle-crashloop` | Exits 1 every time, `restartPolicy: Always`. RESTARTS climbs (2, then 3) and the events show `Back-off restarting failed container` |
| `06-imagepullbackoff.yaml` | `lifecycle-image-error` | Task 3 above |
| `07-readiness.yaml` | `lifecycle-readiness` | `Running` but `0/1`: readiness probe `cat /tmp/ready` fails because the file never exists |
| `08-liveness.yaml` | `lifecycle-liveness` | Healthy for 10s, then `/tmp/healthy` is removed. Liveness probe fails, kubelet kills and restarts the container, RESTARTS goes 0 to 1 |
| `09-startup.yaml` | `lifecycle-startup` | Startup probe (30 x 2s) gates the liveness probe until nginx answers |
| `10-init-container.yaml` | `lifecycle-init` | Shows `Init:0/1` first, then `Running` after `init-setup` finishes |
| `11-multi-container.yaml` | `lifecycle-multi-container` | nginx plus a busybox sidecar, `READY 2/2` |
| `12-termination.yaml` | `lifecycle-termination` | Traps SIGTERM, cleans up for 8s. `kubectl delete` took 9.5s instead of returning instantly |

One thing I noticed: on Kubernetes v1.37 with containerd, the STATUS column for the crashing pod reads `Error` between restarts rather than `CrashLoopBackOff`. The back-off itself is visible in the events (`Warning BackOff ... Back-off restarting failed container`) and in the restart counter.

Commands I ran, from inside `pod-lifecycle/`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f 02-pending.yaml && kubectl get pod lifecycle-pending
kubectl describe pod lifecycle-pending | grep -A 5 Events:

kubectl apply -f 05-crashloopbackoff.yaml && kubectl get pod lifecycle-crashloop
kubectl logs lifecycle-crashloop
kubectl describe pod lifecycle-crashloop | grep BackOff

kubectl apply -f 07-readiness.yaml && kubectl get pod lifecycle-readiness
kubectl apply -f 08-liveness.yaml && kubectl get pod lifecycle-liveness   # RESTARTS 1 after ~40s
kubectl apply -f 09-startup.yaml && kubectl describe pod lifecycle-startup | grep -E "Startup:|Liveness:"

kubectl apply -f 10-init-container.yaml && kubectl get pod lifecycle-init
kubectl logs lifecycle-init -c init-setup
kubectl apply -f 11-multi-container.yaml && kubectl logs lifecycle-multi-container -c sidecar
kubectl apply -f 12-termination.yaml && time kubectl delete -f 12-termination.yaml
```


---

## Task 6: ReplicaSet and StatefulSet

**ReplicaSet.** `nginx-rs` keeps three nginx pods. I deleted one pod by hand (`nginx-rs-fmsxx`) and four seconds later a replacement (`nginx-rs-h5nzd`) was already Running. The ReplicaSet never dropped below `3/3` in `kubectl get rs`.

**StatefulSet.** `mysql` has three replicas, a headless Service (`clusterIP: None`) and a `volumeClaimTemplates` entry, so each pod gets its own 1Gi PersistentVolumeClaim. The pods are named by ordinal (`mysql-0`, `mysql-1`, `mysql-2`) and the PVCs follow the same pattern (`data-mysql-0` ... `data-mysql-2`), all `Bound` through minikube's `standard` storage class.

```bash
kubectl apply -f replicaset.yml
kubectl get rs nginx-rs; kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
kubectl delete pod <one nginx-rs pod>; kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
kubectl delete -f replicaset.yml

kubectl apply -f k8s-core-objects/statefulset.yml
kubectl get statefulset mysql; kubectl get pods -l app=mysql -o wide; kubectl get pvc; kubectl get svc mysql
kubectl delete -f k8s-core-objects/statefulset.yml
```


---

## Task 7: DaemonSets

A DaemonSet runs exactly one pod per eligible node. My cluster has one node, so DESIRED, CURRENT and READY are all `1` for both `node-exporter` (`prom/node-exporter:v1.8.2`) and my lighter `node-agent` (busybox that prints the node name it landed on, read from `spec.nodeName` through the downward API). The agent's log line is `node-agent alive on minikube`.

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s-core-objects/daemonset.yml
kubectl get ds node-exporter; kubectl get pods -l app=node-exporter -o wide
kubectl apply -f daemonset/node-agent-ds.yaml
kubectl get ds node-agent; kubectl logs -l app=node-agent
```


---

## Task 8: Rolling update and rollback (`01-rolling-update/`)

`app-rolling` has four replicas, `maxSurge: 1` and `maxUnavailable: 0`, and a readiness probe so a new pod only counts once nginx answers. v1 uses `nginx:1.25-alpine`, v2 uses `nginx:1.27-alpine`.

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment-v1.yaml -f service.yaml
kubectl rollout status deployment/app-rolling
kubectl apply -f deployment-v2.yaml
kubectl rollout status deployment/app-rolling
kubectl get pods -l app=app-rolling --show-labels
kubectl rollout history deployment/app-rolling
kubectl rollout undo deployment/app-rolling
kubectl rollout status deployment/app-rolling
```

What the output shows:

- During the v2 rollout the status went `1 out of 4 new replicas`, `2 out of 4`, `3 out of 4`, then `1 old replicas are pending termination`. With `maxSurge: 1` there were never more than five pods, and with `maxUnavailable: 0` four were always serving.
- Right after the rollout, `--show-labels` shows four `version=v2` pods Running and the last `version=v1` pod Terminating.
- `rollout history` lists revisions 1 and 2. After `rollout undo` the pods are back on `version=v1` (new hash `65948c9c69`) and history shows revisions 2 and 3, because a rollback is itself a new revision.


---

## Task 9: Troubleshooting drills (`troubleshooting/`)

**Drill 1: broken image during a rollout.** I applied a healthy `web` deployment (`deployment/deployment-v1.yaml`), then `broken-image.yaml`, which is the same Deployment with `nginx:1.99-does-not-exist`. The rollout created one surge pod, which sat in `ImagePullBackOff`, while the three old pods stayed `Running`. `kubectl rollout status --timeout=30s` timed out, and the Deployment condition still said `Available True MinimumReplicasAvailable`, meaning users were never affected. `kubectl rollout undo` removed the bad pod.

**Drill 2: selector does not match the template.** `selector-mismatch.yaml` selects `app: foo` but labels the pods `app: bar`. `kubectl apply --dry-run=client` says `created (dry run)` because that check only happens on the server. The real apply is rejected:

```
The Deployment "selector-error-demo" is invalid: spec.template.metadata.labels: Invalid value: {"app":"bar"}: `selector` does not match template `labels`
```

Fixing the label (`sed "s/app: bar/app: foo/" selector-mismatch.yaml | kubectl apply -f -`) makes it go through and the Deployment reaches `1/1`.


---

## Task 10: Concepts in my own words

**The four ports.** `containerPort` is where the process listens inside the container. `targetPort` is where the Service sends traffic on the pod, and must match it. `port` is the Service's own port on its ClusterIP. `nodePort` (30000 to 32767) is opened on every node for traffic from outside. For a NodePort Service the path is `client -> nodeIP:nodePort -> clusterIP:port -> podIP:targetPort`.

**Labels and selectors.** Labels are key-value tags on objects (`app=myapp`, `slot=blue`). Selectors are how ReplicaSets, Deployments and Services find the pods they own or route to. In Task 11 the whole blue-green switch is just changing one selector value.

**Four deployment strategies.**

- RollingUpdate: replace pods gradually, no downtime, both versions run briefly. Default.
- Recreate: kill every old pod, then start the new ones. Downtime, but never two versions at once.
- Blue-Green: run both versions fully, flip the Service selector. Instant switch and instant rollback, needs double capacity.
- Canary: send a small share of traffic to the new version by running a few new pods behind the same Service, then grow it.

**maxSurge and maxUnavailable.** For `replicas: 4`, `maxSurge: 1`, `maxUnavailable: 0`: at most 5 pods exist during the rollout, and at least 4 are available the whole time. That is exactly what I saw in Task 8.

**Requests and limits.** A request is what the scheduler reserves for the pod (Task 5's 900Gi request could not be placed anywhere). A limit is the ceiling enforced by cgroups: CPU over the limit is throttled, memory over the limit gets the container OOM-killed. `1Gi` is 2^30 bytes, `1G` is 10^9 bytes.

## Task 11: Blue-Green (`02-blue-green/`)

Both `app-blue` and `app-green` run three `hashicorp/http-echo` pods that answer with their own colour and version. `myapp-service` (NodePort 30020) has selector `app=myapp,slot=blue` in `service-blue.yaml` and `slot=green` in `service-green.yaml`.

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment-blue.yaml -f deployment-green.yaml
kubectl apply -f service-blue.yaml
kubectl describe svc myapp-service | grep Selector; kubectl get endpoints myapp-service
minikube ssh -- curl -s http://$(minikube ip):30020      # BLUE ENVIRONMENT - Mayank app v1
kubectl apply -f service-green.yaml
kubectl describe svc myapp-service | grep Selector; kubectl get endpoints myapp-service
minikube ssh -- curl -s http://$(minikube ip):30020      # GREEN ENVIRONMENT - Mayank app v2
kubectl apply -f service-blue.yaml                        # instant rollback
minikube ssh -- curl -s http://$(minikube ip):30020      # BLUE ENVIRONMENT - Mayank app v1
```

The endpoints list switched from the three blue pod IPs (`10.244.0.76-78`) to the three green ones (`10.244.0.79-81`) the moment the selector changed. No pod was restarted.

About the curl: with the Docker driver on macOS the node IP `192.168.49.2` is not routable from the Mac, so I ran curl from inside the node with `minikube ssh`. That still goes through the NodePort.


---

## Task 12: Canary (`03-canary/`)

`app-stable` (9 pods, answers `STABLE v1`) and `app-canary` (1 pod, answers `CANARY v2`) share one Service, `myapp-canary-service`, whose selector is only `app=myapp-canary`. kube-proxy spreads connections across all ten endpoints, so the canary gets roughly one request in ten.

I measured it with 30 requests from a curl pod inside the cluster:

| Pods (stable : canary) | Result of 30 requests |
| --- | --- |
| 9 : 1 | 29 STABLE v1, 1 CANARY v2 |
| 7 : 3 | 23 STABLE v1, 7 CANARY v2 |
| 9 : 0 (canary aborted) | 10 of 10 STABLE v1 |

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment-stable.yaml -f service.yaml -f deployment-canary.yaml
kubectl get pods -l app=myapp-canary --show-labels
kubectl exec curl-client -- sh -c 'for i in $(seq 1 30); do curl -s http://myapp-canary-service; done' | sort | uniq -c
kubectl scale deployment app-canary --replicas=3; kubectl scale deployment app-stable --replicas=7
kubectl scale deployment app-canary --replicas=0; kubectl scale deployment app-stable --replicas=9
```


---

## Task 13: Recreate and the downtime window (`04-recreate/`)

`app-recreate` uses `strategy.type: Recreate`. I ran two extra terminals before applying v2: one with `kubectl get pods -w`, one with a curl loop from the in-cluster curl pod that prints `[OUTAGE]` whenever nothing answers.

The watch shows all three v1 pods go to `Terminating` together, and only after they are gone do the three v2 pods appear as `Pending`, `ContainerCreating`, `Running`. The curl loop shows the gap:

```
VERSION: v1
VERSION: v1
[OUTAGE] no pods answering
VERSION: v2 (UPGRADED)
VERSION: v2 (UPGRADED)
```

The outage was short here because http-echo starts in well under a second and the image was already cached. A heavier app would leave a much longer gap, which is why Recreate is only acceptable when two versions truly cannot coexist.

`kubectl rollout undo` brought back v1 (again with a full stop-then-start), and a final curl returned `VERSION: v1`.
