Three things a real app needs that a plain Deployment does not give you: storage that outlives the Pod, scaling that follows load, and health checks that keep bad Pods out of traffic. The source reference environment was a minikube cluster (v1.37.0, Docker driver, one node) and fresh screenshots are linked in the validation section below.

All 14 manifests pass `kubectl apply --dry-run=client` and were applied for real.

## Setup

HPA needs CPU numbers, so the metrics-server addon has to be on.

```bash
minikube start
minikube addons enable metrics-server
minikube status
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get storageclass
kubectl top nodes
```

`kubectl top nodes` answering is the proof that metrics-server works. The only StorageClass is `standard`, backed by `k8s.io/minikube-hostpath`, and it is the default.


---

## Task 1: Volumes

### 1.1 emptyDir: gone with the Pod

```bash
kubectl apply -f 01-kubernetes-volumes/emptydir-pod.yaml
kubectl exec emptydir-demo -- sh -c 'echo "Hello from Mayank via emptyDir" > /data/message.txt'
kubectl exec emptydir-demo -- cat /data/message.txt
kubectl delete pod emptydir-demo
kubectl apply -f 01-kubernetes-volumes/emptydir-pod.yaml
kubectl exec emptydir-demo -- cat /data/message.txt      # No such file or directory
```

The file is there while the Pod lives and gone the moment the Pod is recreated. emptyDir is scratch space shared between containers of one Pod, nothing more.


### 1.2 hostPath: lands on the node

```bash
kubectl apply -f 01-kubernetes-volumes/hostpath-pod.yaml
kubectl exec hostpath-demo -- sh -c 'echo "Hello from Mayank via hostPath" > /data/message.txt'
minikube ssh -- cat /tmp/mayank-hostpath-data/message.txt
```

The same bytes are visible on the node's own filesystem. That is also why hostPath is a bad idea for real apps: the data is tied to one node, and a Pod rescheduled elsewhere will not see it.


### 1.3 Static PV and PVC

```bash
kubectl apply -f 01-kubernetes-volumes/pv.yaml      # mayank-pv: Available
kubectl apply -f 01-kubernetes-volumes/pvc.yaml     # mayank-pvc: Bound, and the PV flips to Bound
kubectl apply -f 01-kubernetes-volumes/pod.yaml
```

The PV starts `Available`. The claim asks for 500Mi of class `manual` with ReadWriteOnce, which matches, so both become `Bound` and the PV shows `default/mayank-pvc` as its claim.


### 1.4 Data survives the Pod

```bash
kubectl exec storage-demo -- sh -c 'echo "Hello from Mayank via PersistentVolume" > /data/message.txt'
kubectl delete pod storage-demo
kubectl apply -f 01-kubernetes-volumes/pod.yaml
kubectl exec storage-demo -- cat /data/message.txt      # still there
```

Same test as 1.1, opposite result. The file lives in the PV, so a brand-new Pod mounting the same claim reads it back.


### 1.5 Dynamic provisioning

```bash
kubectl describe storageclass standard
kubectl apply -f 01-kubernetes-volumes/dynamic-pvc.yaml
kubectl get pvc dynamic-pvc
kubectl get pv
```

I never wrote a PV for this claim. The `standard` StorageClass created `pvc-d733feb4-...` on demand, 200Mi, reclaim policy `Delete`, and bound it within seconds. That is what every cloud cluster does with EBS, Persistent Disk and friends.


Cleanup: `kubectl delete -f 01-kubernetes-volumes/`.

---

## Task 2: HPA

### 2.1 Deploy

```bash
kubectl apply -f 02-hpa/deployment.yaml -f 02-hpa/service.yaml
```

The container requests `100m` CPU. Without a request the HPA has nothing to compute a percentage against.


### 2.2 Metrics and the HPA object

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metrics-server
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods
kubectl apply -f 02-hpa/hpa.yaml
kubectl get hpa
kubectl describe hpa hpa-demo
```

Right after creation the target reads `<unknown>/50%` and `describe` shows `FailedGetResourceMetric` warnings. That is normal: metrics-server needs about a minute of samples for a new Pod. In the screenshots the target fills in once samples exist.


### 2.3 Load and scale-out

```bash
kubectl run load-generator --image=busybox:1.36 --restart=Never -- /bin/sh -c "while true; do wget -q -O- http://hpa-demo-service; done"
for i in 2 3 4; do kubectl run load-generator-$i ...; done     # nginx is light, one generator is not enough
kubectl get hpa -w                                              # second terminal
```

What the watch showed on my cluster:

| Time | CPU target | Replicas |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 60s | 7% / 50% | 1 |
| 2m | 116% / 50% | 1 |
| 2m15s | 116% / 50% | 3 |
| 3m | 58% / 50% | 3 |
| 4m | 41% / 50% | 3 |

At 116 percent the HPA computed `ceil(1 x 116 / 50) = 3` replicas and scaled to 3 in one step; with three Pods sharing the load, utilisation dropped under the target and it stopped there. `describe hpa` records the step as `SuccessfulRescale: New size: 3; reason: cpu resource utilization (percentage of request) above target`, and `kubectl top pods` shows each Pod at about 41m.


### 2.4 Stop the load and scale-in

```bash
kubectl delete pod load-generator load-generator-2 load-generator-3 load-generator-4
kubectl get hpa -w
```

CPU fell to 0 percent within a minute, but the replica count stayed at 3 for the default five-minute stabilisation window, then went 3 to 2 to 1 over the next two minutes. The window exists so a short dip in traffic does not throw Pods away that will be needed again.


### How the number is computed

`desiredReplicas = ceil(currentReplicas x currentUtilisation / targetUtilisation)`, clamped to `minReplicas`..`maxReplicas`. A request of 100m and usage of 50m is 50 percent. One Pod at 116 percent with a 50 percent target gives 3.

Cleanup: `kubectl delete -f 02-hpa/`.

## Task 3: Mini project, a production-shaped web app

Namespace `production-webapp`, a 500Mi PVC mounted at `/data`, two nginx replicas with startup, readiness and liveness probes and CPU requests, a ClusterIP Service, and an HPA from 2 to 5 replicas at 50 percent CPU.

```
                     Service web-service :80
                               │
            ┌──────────────────┼──────────────────┐
            ▼                  ▼                  ▼
      web-app pod        web-app pod        web-app pod (added by HPA)
      startup/readiness/liveness probes, cpu request 100m
            └──────────── HPA web-app-hpa (50% CPU) ◄── metrics-server
      /data ── PVC web-data (500Mi RWO) ── StorageClass standard
```

### 3.1 to 3.3 Deploy

```bash
kubectl apply -f 03-mini-project/namespace.yaml -f 03-mini-project/pvc.yaml
kubectl apply -f 03-mini-project/deployment.yaml -f 03-mini-project/service.yaml
kubectl apply -f 03-mini-project/hpa.yaml
```


### 3.4 Storage persistence

```bash
POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -n production-webapp -l app=web-app -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -n production-webapp "$POD_NAME" -- sh -c 'echo "Student: Mayank" > /data/student.txt'
kubectl delete pod -n production-webapp "$POD_NAME"
NEW_POD=$(kubectl get pods -n production-webapp -l app=web-app -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -n production-webapp "$NEW_POD" -- cat /data/student.txt     # Student: Mayank
```


### 3.5 Service

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n production-webapp svc/web-service 8080:80
curl http://localhost:8080
```


### 3.6 HPA under load

Same load generators as Task 2, in the namespace. The HPA went from 2 to 3 replicas when CPU hit 62 percent, settled at 41 to 46 percent with three Pods, and after the load was removed and the five-minute window passed, returned to 2.


### 3.7 Bonus: readiness gating

```bash
kubectl patch deployment web-app -n production-webapp --type=json \
  -p='[{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/readinessProbe/httpGet/path","value":"/does-not-exist"}]'
kubectl get pods -n production-webapp
kubectl get endpoints -n production-webapp web-service
```

This produced something more interesting than "all Pods unready". Patching a Deployment starts a rolling update, and the new Pod (`web-app-8577565fb7-ktxfk`) came up `Running` but `0/1` because nginx answers 404 on `/does-not-exist`. Because it never became Ready, the rollout stopped there: the Deployment's `maxUnavailable` kept the two old, healthy Pods serving, and the Service endpoints still listed exactly those two. Readiness failures remove a Pod from traffic without restarting it, and here they also stopped a bad rollout from ever reaching users.


### 3.8 Bonus: liveness restart loop

```bash
kubectl apply -f 03-mini-project/deployment.yaml      # restore
kubectl patch deployment web-app -n production-webapp --type=json \
  -p='[{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/livenessProbe/httpGet/path","value":"/crash"}]'
kubectl get pods -n production-webapp -w
```

The liveness probe hits `/crash`, nginx returns 404, and after three failures five seconds apart the kubelet restarts the container: the watch shows `RESTARTS` ticking to 1 about 15 seconds after the new Pods start, and the cycle repeats. Liveness restarts; readiness only unplugs. Restoring the manifest brought both replicas back to `1/1`.


### Probe cheat sheet

| Probe | Question | On failure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Startup | Has the process finished booting? | Container restarted; other probes wait until it passes |
| Readiness | Can this Pod take traffic right now? | Pod IP removed from Service endpoints; no restart |
| Liveness | Is the container still alive? | Kubelet restarts the container |

### Things that went wrong and how I checked

| Symptom | Check | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HPA shows `<unknown>/50%` | `kubectl top pods -n production-webapp` | metrics-server not ready, or no CPU request | Wait a minute; keep `cpu: 100m` in the request |
| One load generator did not move the needle | `kubectl top pods` | nginx serves a static page in microseconds | Start three more generators |
| Pods did not all go unready in 3.7 | `kubectl get endpoints` | A Deployment rolls out gradually and keeps old Pods until new ones are Ready | Expected behaviour; see 3.7 |

Cleanup: `kubectl delete namespace production-webapp`.

## What I took away

- emptyDir is per-Pod scratch, hostPath is per-node, and a PVC is the only one that survives rescheduling.
- A PV is the storage; a PVC is the request for it; a StorageClass is the factory that makes PVs on demand.
- The HPA is arithmetic on `usage / request`. No request, no scaling. It scales out fast and in slowly, on purpose.
- Readiness protects users from a Pod; liveness protects a Pod from itself; startup protects slow apps from liveness.
